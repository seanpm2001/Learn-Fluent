# Project language file 1
# For: seanpm2001/Learn-Fluent
# About:
# I decided to make Fluent the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Fluent) as Fluent is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Fluent programming language. It only makes sense to Fluent the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
